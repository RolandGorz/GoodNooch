Made during a Rutgers Hackathon. 

An Android application written in Java that allowsusers to take pictures of nutrition labels with theirphones.  The image of the label is then parsed fortext relating to calories, fat, vitamins, etc. This in-formation is then stored and shown to the user asboth a total value for the day and a percent for thesuggested daily intake.  It utilizes Googleâ€™s visionAPI for character recognition.
