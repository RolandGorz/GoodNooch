# GoodNooch

Made during a Rutgers Hackathon. 

An Android application written in Java that allows users to take pictures of nutrition labels with their phones.  The image of the label is then parsed for text relating to calories, fat, vitamins, etc. This information is then stored and shown to the user as both a total value for the day and a percent for the suggested daily intake.  It utilizes Googleâ€™s vision API for character recognition.
